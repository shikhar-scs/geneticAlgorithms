# Analysis

Initially, a random function generator generates 20 diff chromosomes. The ones with no. of set bits>10 are chosen and thus the first fit population is formed.

Now these, are mixed & matched on a random basis & a track of their parents is kept. In every generation, the best 50% are chosen (on the basis of the fitness function). There parents are also chosen & now, a new generation set is generated.
A track of the best chromosome in every generation is kept, & also all participating chromosomes are stored in the population. 

As we can observe, the value `li-hc`, which is also the fitness of a chromosome, improves over time. Multiple instances of the program can be run to verify the same.
Starting from 1.51 -> 2.66 , a significant improvement.
