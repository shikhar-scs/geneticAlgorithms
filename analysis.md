# Analysis

## The very first randomized search space

Initially, 20 different chromosome sets are randomly generated, which also serve as the primary population.

## The first eligible chromosome set

Chromosomes with no. of set bits > 10 (attendance should be atleast 50%) are chosen and this forms the first fit population set.

Now, 2 chromosome sets are randomly picked up from the eligible set. **Crossover** is performed & a new child chromosome is generated.

Next, to facilitate **mutation** , a random bit is flipped. Our child chromosome is now ready & thus, its fitness is calculated. 

In every generation, the best 50%, along with their parents are chosen (on the basis of the fitness function) & the processes of crossover & mutation are performed again.

The best chromosome of every generation is tracked

## Best chromosome in i'th population 

As we can observe, the value `li-hc`, which is also the `fitness` of a chromosome, improves over time. Multiple instances of the program can be run to verify the same.

Starting from 1.51 -> 2.66 , a significant improvement.

## Inference

Running the algo for a higher no of generations will give a better result, unless we hit a bottle-neck. The process can be stopped now.
